Technical details, operating tips and notes on the limitations of cyg-apt.
Configuration

cyg-apt gets its configuration from .cyg-apt, created in your home directory. This .rc file can be modified at will:

Typical .cyg-apt:

mirror="http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/cygwin/"
cache="/e/home/application_data/cygwin_1_7"
setup_ini="/etc/setup/setup-2.ini"
distname="curr"
barred="python cygwin base-cygwin coreutils bash zlib libreadline"
ROOT="/"

You can set mirror, cache, ini, distname and root from the command line, but edit the .rc to make changes stick.
mirror 	Cygwin mirror site
cache 	Cygwin package cache
setup_ini 	The package list downloaded from the mirror
distname 	The distribution: current previous or test.
barred 	Packages cyg-apt must not work with.
ROOT 	For future use

When cyg-apt setup is run, .cyg-apt is generated by looking at the files setup.exe places in /etc/setup to indicate the last cache and mirror used: these are taken as good starting defaults for cache and mirror.

You can also have another .cyg-apt in a local directory as an override.
Run cyg-apt update regularly

cyg-apt doesn't currently download setup-2.ini every time it runs. This is handy when performing several operations with cyg-apt, particularly local operations, given that a typical setup.ini now weighs in at 1 meg. The downside is that you might be operating against outdated package information: run cyg-apt update to get back into sync with your mirror.
Cygwin 1.7 special casing

During the Cygwin 1.7 Beta program, Cygwin 1.7 references setup-2.ini, rather than setup.ini. I expect this to change back to setup.ini when 1.7 leaves beta. cyg-apt will need to be re-released/updated to generate the correct default setup_ini filename when this happens. Of course you can just change setup_ini to point to the right file: I expect setup.ini to continue to live under /etc/setup.
Updating core Cygwin

cyg-apt can't do this itself and I'm not sure at this stage that it is even a good idea for it to try. I've got plans for making cyg-apt runnable from a dos box opening up this possibility but I'm not sure that working with Cygwin core is wise, even in principle: the core packages are the jurisdiction of the official Cygwin developers.
Python dependence

cyg-apt can't work with the packages it itself depends on. Being a Python script this boils down to Python and some of its dependencies. I have found that this is not a showstopper in practice: these packages are not frequently updated, and we have them when we install cyg-apt.

For updating the core we must return to Cygwin's official installer, which is the correct procedure in any case.

cyg-apt checks the packages it works on and skips over the core and Python packages with a warning.
Source packages

cyg-apt restricts itself to simply downloading and unzipping the source package to the current working directory. I was not sure if it would help to kick off the application of the Cygwin specific patches as well.
