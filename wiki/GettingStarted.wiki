_Instructions for getting cyg-apt working._

Installing cyg-apt requires a Cygwin install with Python: download the zipped script, unzip and place it in your path, then run
{{{
$cyg-apt setup
}}}

==Details==

  * It is expected that you have already performed a base Cygwin install. cyg-apt is intended to help manage packages in an existing installation. 

  * Additionally you will need to have Cygwin Python. If you are not sure whether you have Python, at a Cygwin prompt:
{{{
$ python --help
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
...
}}}
  * If you don't have Python, launch your Cygwin installer: setup.exe
    o At the Cygwin Setup - Select Packages 
    o Select the python package under the interpreters section.
    o Ensure other selections are correct and click "Next" to install. 

  * Download cyg-apt from this site.
  * Unzip the download with your favourite unzipper: from Cygwin
{{{
$ tar -xf cyg-apt-1.0.0-1.tar.bz2
}}}
The unpacked cyg-apt-1.0.0-1 directory contains the script cyg-apt. Transfer this script to your path. Typically this means moving the script to /usr/bin or your own private $HOME/bin directory if you have one in your path.
{{{
$ cd cyg-apt-1.0.0-1
$ cp cyg-apt /usr/bin
}}}
* Run setup 
{{{
$ cyg-apt setup
cyg-apt: creating /home/chrisc/.cyg-apt.
}}}
cyg-apt will now be ready to use: Example operations:
{{{
$ cyg-apt --help
$ cyg-apt install nano
$ cyg-apt list
}}}
